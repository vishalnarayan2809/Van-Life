## 🌐 Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the application to Netlify:

1. **Create a production build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy using Netlify CLI** (Option 1)
   
   Install Netlify CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install netlify-cli -g
   ```
   
   Deploy your site:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```
   
   Follow the prompts:
   - Select "Create & configure a new site"
   - Choose your team
   - Enter a site name (or leave blank for auto-generated name)
   - Specify the publish directory as `dist`
   
   Once satisfied with the preview, deploy to production:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Deploy via Netlify Dashboard** (Option 2)
   
   a. Sign up or log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
   
   b. Click "New site from Git"
   
   c. Connect to your GitHub repository
   
   d. Configure build settings:
      - Build command: `npm run build`
      - Publish directory: `dist`
      - Environment variables: Add all your Firebase config variables from `.env`
   
   e. Click "Deploy site"

4. **Configure Redirects for React Router**
   
   Create a `_redirects` file in the `public` folder with:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
   ```
   
   Or add to `netlify.toml` in your project root:
   ```toml
   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

5. **Set up Environment Variables**
   
   In the Netlify dashboard, go to:
   - Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add all variables from your `.env` file
   
   Example:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   ...etc
   ```

Your site will be live at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`!
